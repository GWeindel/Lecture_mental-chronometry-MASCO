# Lecture_mental-chronometry-MASCO
Slides and code for the course given to the 1st year master students of the Master de Sciences Cognitives at Aix-Marseille University 2020

The code is intended to be run in class along with the slides from lecture 2

Update : github does not seem to render R notebooks so the HTML files allow to display the notebooks
